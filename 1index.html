                telephone as a way to communicate between the stage and control room at the theatre "Teatro della Pergola"
                in Florence. This telephone was constructed on the model of pipe-telephones on ships and is still functional

In 1854        that was first published in a magazine L'Illustration (Paris), though no prototype was built. That is about the

                British company Standard Telephones and Cables (STC).The results also confirmed it could faintly transmit and
                receive speech. At the time STC was bidding for acontract with Alexander Graham Bell's American Telephone and
                Telegraph Company, and the results were coveredup by STC's chairman Sir Frank Gill to maintain Bell's
                reputation.</span></p>

    <h3> TELEPHONE PREHISTORY</h3>
    <hr>
    <h4>Mechanical Devices</h4>
    <div><p>Before the invention of electromagnetic telephones, mechanical acoustic devices existed for transmitting speech
        and music over a distance greater than that of normal direct speech. The earliest mechanical telephones were based
        on sound transmission through pipes or other physical media.[1] The acoustic tin can telephone, or "lovers' phone",
        has been known for centuries. It connects two diaphragms with a taut string or wire, which transmits sound by mechanical
        vibrations from one to the other along the wire (and not by a modulated electric current). The classic example is the
        children's toy made by connecting the bottoms of two paper cups, metal cans, or plastic bottles with tautly held
        string</p></div>
    <div><p>For a few years in the late 1800s, acoustic telephones were marketed commercially as a niche competitor to the
        electrical telephone. When the Bell telephone patents expired and many new telephone manufacturers began competing,
        acoustic telephone makers quickly went out of business. Their maximum range was very limited.[2] An example of one
        such company was the Pulsion Telephone Supply Company created by Lemuel Mellett in Massachusetts, which designed its
        version in 1888 and deployed it on railroad right-of-ways.</p></div>

        <div><p>Additionally, speaking tubes have long been common, especially within buildings and aboard ships, and are still in
        use today. [5]</p></div>
    <hr>
<h4>Elecrical Devices</h4>

    <div><p>The telephone emerged from the making and successive improvements of the electrical telegraph. In 1804, Spanish polymath
    and scientist Francisco Salva Campillo constructed an electrochemical telegraph.[6] The first working telegraph was built
    by the English inventor Francis Ronalds in 1816 and used static electricity.[7] An electromagnetic telegraph was created by
    Baron Schilling in 1832. Carl Friedrich Gauss and Wilhelm Weber built another electromagnetic telegraph in 1833 in Göttingen.
    </p></div>


    <div><p>The electrical telegraph was first commercialised by Sir William Fothergill Cooke and entered use on the Great Western Railway
    in England. It ran for 13 mi (21 km) from Paddington station to West Drayton and came into operation on April 9, 1839.
    </p></div>

   <div><p> Another electrical telegraph was independently developed and patented in the United States in 1837 by Samuel Morse. His assistant,
    Alfred Vail, developed the Morse code signaling alphabet with Morse. America's first telegram was sent by Morse on January 6, 1838,
    across 2 miles (3 km) of wiring.</p></div>

    <h4>Invention Of The Telephone</h4>
    <div><p>Credit for the invention of the electric telephone is frequently disputed, and new controversies over the issue
        have arisen from time to time. Charles Bourseul, Innocenzo Manzetti, Antonio Meucci, Johann Philipp Reis, Alexander
        Graham Bell, and Elisha Gray, amongst others, have all been credited with the telephone's invention. The early history
        of the telephone became and still remains a confusing morass of claims and counterclaims, which were not clarified by
        the huge mass of lawsuits to resolve the patent claims of many individuals and commercial competitors. The Bell and Edison
        patents, however, were commercially decisive, because they dominated telephone technology and were upheld by court decisions
        in the United States.</p></div>
